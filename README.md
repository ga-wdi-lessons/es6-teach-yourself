#ES6

## Learning Objectives

- Compare/contrast features of ES5 and ES6
- Explain when to use var vs let vs const
- Use default parameters and arrow functions
- Use template literals to interpolate variables and strings
- Compare ES6 classes w/ ES5 prototypes
- Use import/export syntax with modules
- Use deconstruction to extract values from objects and arrays

## A Brief History of JavaScript

The JavaScript standard is referred to as EcmaScript.

I like to think of EcmaScript as the language, and JavaScript an implementation of that language.

ES3 was the first widespread use of the language. Unfortunately, ES4 never came out.

In 2009, ES5 was finalized and it's what we've been writing in class.

2015 brought ES6, published as a standard on June 17th, 2015.

### Why now?

Many plugins, frameworks and modules still use ES5, as browser support for
the new version of the language is still limited [ahem... ie.](http://caniuse.com/#search=es6)

Later today and next week, we'll be working with a framework called React, and many
React tutorials (and our lesson plans) have adopted the new syntax and features
of ES6. Today is all about exploring those features and getting comfortable with
the new syntax.

### Teach Yourself (& the Class)

As you've probably noticed, we've gradually been putting the onus on you to mess around with new technologies with limited support from us. Why? Because you already have the foundation to learn everything you need to know about web development.

ES6 was released last summer, when I was about halfway through my time as a student in WDI. It wasn't part of the curriculum at the time. But did that mean I didn't have to learn it? Of course not. Your learning in web development only starts with WDI, but it'll continue throughout your careers.

You'll be leaving us in a few weeks. We're going to miss youâ€”seriously, you guys have been the best. But while we still have you, we want you to be prepared to learn new things without any help from us as you'll be expected to do when you join the workforce. We also want you to be able to talk about what you've learned.

Today, we're going to teach each other ES6.

### Groups

You'll break up into four groups to research, implement and provide presentations on the following concepts in ES6.

#### Group 1
- Block Scope
- Modules
- Destructuring

#### Group 2
- Arrow Functions
- Default Parameters
- Concise properties and methods

#### Group3:
- Getters and Setters
- Template literals

#### Group 4:
- Classes
- Spread


### Deliverables

- Create one lesson plan repo for all the concepts your group has been assigned.
- For each concept, provide two demos showcasing the ES6 implementations.
- Create one example of how the feature would have been implemented in ES5.
- Present your group's findings to the class. Be prepared to talk about the concepts and demonstrate your implementations. Each group will have 10 minutes to present. Plan to have three minutes at the end for questions. All group members must speak.

You have until 11:30 to work. We'll then reconvene in the classroom for presentations. This repo will be updated with your lessons plans.
